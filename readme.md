# Array Cardio

more things to make my brain hurt,

# TIL

* implicit returns which were pretty tuff
* the ... method instead of slice.  Of course, I guess you need to know what slice does (I mean I get it, but it's still new to me)
* how to markup in the Readme.md
* much more at ease with working in Github (might seem small to seasoned devs, huge for me)
* how to customize Atom (again, small I know, but big for me for readability)

I feel like I've made progress
